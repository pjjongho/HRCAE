## Our operating environment
* Python 3.8
* pytorch  1.10.1
* and other necessary libs

## Guide 
* This repository provides a concise framework for unsupervised anomaly detection for machine tools under noises. It includes a demo dataset; the pre-processing process for the data and the model proposed in the paper. We have also integrated 2 baseline methods for comparison.
* You just need to run `start_procedure.py`. You can also adjust the structure and parameters of the model to suit your needs.

## Pakages
* `data` contians a demo dataset
* `datasets` contians the pre-processing process and the type of added noise for the data
* `models` contians the proposed model and 2 base models
* `utils` contians train&val&test processes
